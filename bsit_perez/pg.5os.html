                  <p>An operating system (OS) is the program that manages all of the other application programs in a computer after being loaded into the computer by a boot program. The most crucial piece of computer software is the operating system. It manages the hardware, software, operations, and memory of the computer.</p>

                <ul class="list-unstyled list-line mb-5">
                  <li>Linux</li>
                   <p>Linux is an open-source operating system that is free to use. Linus Torvalds designed it in 1991, and it has since become one of the world's most commonly used operating systems. Linux is a Unix-like operating system that is frequently regarded as a viable alternative to proprietary operating systems such as Microsoft Windows and Apple's macOS. Linux is well-known for its stability, security, and versatility, making it a popular choice for a wide range of applications such as servers, desktops, and embedded systems. Linux is also extremely adaptable, allowing users to tailor the operating system to their individual requirements.</p>
                   <p>One of the primary benefits of Linux is that it is open-source, allowing developers to freely access and modify the source code. This has resulted in a large developer community that contributes to the development and improvement of the operating system. Linux is used as the foundation for many other operating systems, including Android for mobile devices and Chrome OS for Chromebooks, in addition to being used as a standalone operating system.</p>
                  <li>MacOS</li>
                  <p>Apple Inc. created the macOS operating system for their line of Mac computers. It is a proprietary, Unix-based operating system that was first released as Mac OS X in 2001 and was renamed macOS in 2016. macOS is well-known for its user-friendly design and emphasis on the user experience. It comes with a desktop environment that includes a Dock for launching apps, a Finder for managing files and directories, and a number of built-in applications for tasks like email, online browsing, and photo management.</p>
                  <p>macOS is built to work in tandem with Apple's devices and applications, such as iPhones, iPads, and the Apple Watch. It also works with Apple's internet services, like as iCloud, to create a unified experience across all of a user's Apple devices. macOS is well-known for its stability and security, as well as its ability to handle demanding apps including video editing software, graphic design tools, and scientific simulations. Overall, macOS is a popular choice for Mac users who appreciate a user-friendly and integrated computing experience and who require a high-performance operating system for demanding work.</p>
                  <li>Windows</li>
                  <p>Microsoft created Windows as an operating system. The operating system is responsible for allowing you to operate a computer. Windows comes preloaded on the majority of new personal computers (PCs), which contributes to its status as the world's most popular operating system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Windows allows you to perform a wide range of common operations on your computer. Windows, for example, can be used to surf the Internet, check email, edit digital images, listen to music, play games, and much more.</p>

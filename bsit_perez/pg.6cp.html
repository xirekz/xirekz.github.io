                  <p>Computers have existed for a long time. Computers were formerly primarily used by scientists and engineers to make calculations and solve issues. Nonetheless, computers have become more widespread in everyday life during the last few decades. Computers are now utilized for recreational purposes such as gaming and watching YouTube videos. They are also utilized for business applications, such as online banking or bill payment. Computing platforms are the hardware and software components that comprise a computer system. They serve as the foundation for all other components of a computer system. A computing platform is not just one thing, but rather it is an evolving combination of many different elements that work together to provide an environment for running programs and performing tasks.</p>

                  <li>Cloud Computing</li>
                  <p>The term "cloud computing" refers to the delivery of computer services and software as a service. This means that users can use these services at any time, from any device. Cloud computing offers several advantages over traditional data and information storage systems since it provides for simple access to all data without requiring it to be stored on local devices. The key benefit of cloud computing is its low cost because it requires less energy than traditional methods of data storage. Another benefit is that customers can use their devices while working or playing online without fear of losing their progress or settings because everything is saved in the cloud.</p>

                  <p>
                  There are numerous sorts of clouds, including public, private, community, and hybrid clouds. Public clouds are shared by several organizations, whereas private clouds are utilized by a single organization but may be shared with other organizations if they wish. Public cloud resources are accessible from any location, at any time, and on any device. Private cloud resources can only be accessed by the firm that owns the cloud's server/storage unit. Cloud storage is an excellent method of storing data since it is secure and is backed up in the event of an emergency or disaster.
                  </p>

                  <li>Virtualization</li>
                  <p>Virtualization has been used on mainframes and minicomputers since the 1970s, but it wasn't popular on personal computers until the mid-1990s. Because it used a layer of software emulation to replicate the behavior of a real computer, the earliest version of virtualization was called paravirtualization. This enabled programs designed for one type of computer to run on another without any modifications. Although paravirtualization is still used today, it has been replaced by full virtualization, which offers total isolation from hardware resources as well as direct access to memory and peripheral devices. Physical computers or other virtual machines can be used to construct virtual machines.</p>
